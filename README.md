# base-secure

Base-secure uses [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com) to automate the setup of new hosts with a fully updated, hardened OS, with hardened SSH settings.

__NOTICE__ if you don't have Ansible installed, base-secure will do that first via Pip, automatically!

## Requirements

* Linux
* python3
* sudo
* git

## Usage

Checkout the code, change into the directory:

```
git clone https://github.com/philcryer/base-secure.git
cd base-secure
```

Run it:

```
./base-secure
```
